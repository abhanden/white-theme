# white-theme
this is my arch/hyprland theme!

# dotfiles

my personal linux configs for wayland and vim setups. mainly includes waybar, hyprland, lazyvim and some scripts i use to keep my workflow smooth.

## included configs

- **waybar** – custom status bar for sway/hyprland, with modules and themes  
- **lazyvim** – neovim setup with lazy-loaded plugins, optimized for speed  
- **hyprland** – compositor config with smart keybindings and workspace rules  
- **scripts** – misc shell scripts and helpers for daily tasks  

## philosophy

keep it minimal, modular and readable. configs are portable and easy to tweak, optimized for arch/arch-based distros. everything here is meant for learning or personal use, so feel free to adapt.  

## installation

backup your current configs first. then clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eymen/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
